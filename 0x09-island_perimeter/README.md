# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Algorithm

**Python**

---

### Project Overview

This project focuses on calculating the perimeter of an island in a grid (2D array) representation. The island is represented by `1`s (land) and `0`s (water) in the grid. The objective is to determine the perimeter of the island.

### Key Concepts

- **2D Arrays (Matrices)**:
  - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
  - Navigating through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

- **Conditional Logic**:
  - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

- **Counting Techniques**:
  - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

- **Problem-Solving Strategies**:
  - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

### Requirements

- **General**:
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.4.3)
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
  - Code should follow the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
  - No external modules should be imported
  - All modules and functions must be documented
  - All files must be executable
